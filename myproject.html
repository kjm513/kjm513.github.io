                    <h3>My first Counter-Strike map</h3>
                    <h4>Description / personal critique</h4>
                    <p>My first ever attempt at making a map for Counter-Strike, it takes place in a underground pyramid like structure. In my honest opinion it's visually pleasing but plays terribly. The map suffers from weird sightlines and deep corners which discourages map rotation and the overall flow of the map is weird to play since most routes have 3 different ways of being flanked.</p>

                    <h3>My Second second Counter-strike map</h3>
                    <h4>Description / personal critique</h4>
                    <p>My second map for Counter-Strike takes place in a underground subway and offers some verticality to the gameplay. I think came out a little better in terms of gameplay since the routes to take are a bit more structured and thought out but visually it could use some work. I made this map when I was 18yrs old and at that time I had no real experience on how scaling worked so some things appear larger than they should along with me not being able to find a good reference for a subway station.</p>

                <h3>Work in-progress Left 4 dead 2 campaign</h3>
                <h4>Description / personal critique</h4>
                <p>This is my first big project, I am trying to create an entire "campaign"(four or five missions) for Left 4 Dead 2. I started this back in 2020 with development started to become on and off around summer/fall of 2021 due to increased demand from school and work. It starts off on a traffic jammed highway that forces you to navigate through a patch of forest till you reach a back road. From there you find a gas station and move to the next level. The next level you follow the back road till you find a sewer drain that leads into a city and the rest is work in-progress. From the screenshots below it's pretty obvious how early in development this really is but I would say that I'm pretty proud with how far it has come. Hopefully I'll finish it after I graduate.</p>
